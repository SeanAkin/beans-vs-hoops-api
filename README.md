# Beans vs Hoops API

## Overview

The **Beans vs Hoops API** is the backend for the fun voting project inspired by a festival debate: **Spaghetti Hoops vs Baked Beans**. Users simply vote for their favorite option, and the API tracks and updates the results displayed on the [Beans vs Hoops UI](https://github.com/JoeR96/beans-vs-hoops). The live results can be viewed at [hoopsvsbeans.com](https://hoopsvsbeans.com).

## Features

- **Vote Tracking**: Users can vote for either Spaghetti Hoops or Baked Beans.
- **Simple and Fun**: A lighthearted, festival-inspired debate turned into a web project.
